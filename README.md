# **Proposal for a Predictive Analysis of Failure Risk in Software Test Cases Using Agile Methodologies**

This repository contains the code, simulations, and experiments developed as part of the research project:

✍️ **Authors:** Brayan Jesus Sanchez Avila, Saul Isui Lugo Martinez  
🏫 **Institutions:** Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo, Tecnológico Nacional de México campus Pachuca  

---
## 📌 Description

The goal of this project is to provide the code and experiments associated with the article so that other researchers can:

- Reproduce the simulations presented in the paper.  
- Review and adapt the code for new research.  
- Access datasets and configurations used in the experiments.  

This repository **does not replace** reading the full article. Instead, it complements the paper with practical resources.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run the project, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x  
- Scientific libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`  
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook to reproduce experiments step by step  

Install dependencies with:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🚀 Execution

Example run from the CLI:

`python src/main.py --dataset datasets/dataset.csv --output results/`

Example run with Jupyter Notebook:

`jupyter notebook notebooks/simulation.ipynb`

## 📊 Expected Results

The simulations provide comparable metrics to those reported in the paper, including:

- Prediction success and error rates.
- Comparative plots between different models.
- Visual representation of processed data.
